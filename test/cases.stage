This should be a straight line.
@test Should have a single class.
@abc.def Multiple classes. Primary should be the first class.
@#id.class Ids and classes.
@mixing.#ids Should have mixing class and id. Primary is always the id if one exists.
@#multiple.#ids should use the last value as an id.
@not#an_id You need a `.` to separate different fields in @ shorthand.
